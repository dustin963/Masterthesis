# Masterthesis


The GitHub project is organised as follows:

The folder Underlying Python Files includes the Python code written for this project. Including the BERT Model, the web scraper, the data analysis and the sentiment analysis.

The .stremlit folder is relevant because the corresponding Online Version of the Analysis uses this GitHub Project. It can be accessed here:
https://share.streamlit.io/dustin963/masterthesis/main/WebappforData.py

For this purpose are also the majority of other files, like the WebappforData.py and the underlying HTML files.
In addition, the file "15.06NRautoreduced to 100.xlsx" includes the dataset.
